# Titanic--Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

This project aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic disaster using machine learning.

### Data
We'll be using the Kaggle Titanic dataset which includes passenger information like name, age, gender etc. You can find more details about the data here.

### Goal
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster based on the provided features.

### Evaluation
The project's success will be measured by the model's accuracy on a unseen test set.

### Next Steps:
**Data exploration and cleaning**

**Feature engineering**

**Model selection and training**

**Model evaluation**

**Conclusion and future work**
